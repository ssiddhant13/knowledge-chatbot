Ensure that the product has at least one active PriceBookEntry corresponding to the catalog. General troubleshooting guidelines: Ensure that the correct PriceList is assigned to the passed Catalog. Ensure that the correct PriceBook is assigned to the corresponding PriceList. Try modifying LIMIT and OFFSET parameters if the queries do not return valid records. Caveats If your execution fails because of Apex limits, try the following: Use the paginationLimit & paginationOffset parameters of the method PlePbeSanityValidation.validate() to split execution across multiple apex invocations. If the total number of PriceListEntries in the PriceList exceeds 17k , this script might not work out of the box (because SOQL query does not permit OFFSET > 2000 ). Filters can be added on CreatedDate field in the CatalogProductRelationship__c SOQL query, that can help limit rows before OFFSET is applied. Background For every Product, there are 2 important commonly-confused SObjects that serve distinct yet crucial purposes: S.No. Entity Name SObject Name Join between Purpose 1. PriceBookEntry PricebookEntry (Product, PriceBook) Used to create line items 2. PriceListEntry PriceListEntry__c (Product, PriceList, PricingElement) Used to price a line item The absence of any of these SObjects for a product in the context of their Catalog/PriceList can cause relevant use cases to fail. The script helps identify if that is the cause.

For Performance-related problems in CPQ or Digital Commerce products, that may manifest as: Longer API response times Apex Governor limit violations, such as SOQL query limit Apex Heap size limit CPU Timeout DML Limit Tool Description The tool helps us identify oversized bundles which are a common cause for failures of our APIs, by estimating heap size utilization for various APIs based on certain data shape dimensions . How To Use Open the sheet of the respective API, in the Google Sheet tool link provided at the top of the page. Type in the data shape dimensions, highlighted in yellow . To gather this information from the customer org, the following tools may be useful: Observe the estimated heap size, based on the input, highlighted in blue . Output If Estimated Heap Size (in KB) is greater than 6000, there is a strong chance that the bundle configurations are oversized. Caveats This is only an estimation of Heap usage for respective APIs, which may vary based on a lot of factors, some of which are Pricing overrides, Attribute overrides, Configuration Rules etc. This exercise has been limited to Classic CPQ & DC APIs, not Standard CPQ (CPQ Next) APIs .

For problems in CPQ or Digital Commerce products related to: Promotion application, especially under a bundle hierarchy Overrides on bundle Tool Description The script identifies incorrect Product Hierarchy Path fields, by performing the following validations on records of the selected SObject type (PromotionItem__c or OverrideDefinition__c): ProductHierarchyPath__c field must not be blank. Ids in ProductHierarchyPath__c field must belong to products in the org. Derived field ProductHierarchyGroupKeyPath__c must be correct. How To Use Download the script file ProductHierarchyPathValidation.apex , available as a page attachment. Copy the contents of the file to the Execute Anonymous window within Developer Console (Help doc link) . Add this line to the top of the text area by replacing method parameters (sObjectTypeName can be \\'PromotionItem__c\\' or \\'OverrideDefinition__c\\'): ProductHierarchyPathValidation val = new ProductHierarchyPathValidation(<sObjectTypeName>);\\nval.validate(<paginationLimit>, <paginationOffset>); Execute the script, and interpret the results available as USER_DEBUG in debug logs as per details in the next section. Output Result Info logs (Log lines appended by RESULT_INFO| ): S.No. Message Meaning 1. Evaluating \"<n>\" sObjects of type \"<type>\" with Ids: [\"<id1>\", ...] This is the list of all sObjects of type \\'PromotionItem__c\\' or \\'OverrideDefinition__c\\' being validated. Please verify if the number and type of the sObjects, along with their ids are correct. 2. Successfully completed validation. This script could not find any issues. No action needed. Result Warning logs (Log lines appended by RESULT_WARNING| ): S.No. Message How to Fix 1. ProductHierarchyPath__c field is blank for: [\"<id1>\", ...] Ensure ProductHierarchyPath__c field is correctly populated for the SObject Ids in the log message. 2. Following Ids in ProductHierarchyPath__c field do not belong to products in the org: [\"invalidProductId1\", ...]. Affected SObjects are: [\"sObjectIdsWithInvalidProductId1\", ...] Ensure that the affected SObjects have valid Product Ids in their ProductHierarchyPath__c. 3. Derived product hierarchy path field (ProductHierarchyGroupKeyPath__c) invalid for: [\"<id1>\", ...] Ensure ProductHierarchyGroupKeyPath__c field is correct corresponding to the ProductHierarchyPath__c field, for the SObject Ids in the log message. Running the following job can resolve this: CMT Admin Console > Upgrade Jobs > Populate Product Hierarchy Group Key Path Caveats If your execution fails because of Apex limits, try the following: Use the paginationLimit & paginationOffset parameters of the method ProductHierarchyPathValidation.validate() to split execution across multiple apex invocations. If the total number of SObjects in the PriceList exceeds 15k , this script might not work out of the box (because SOQL query does not permit OFFSET > 2000 ). Filters can be added on CreatedDate field in the first SOQL query, that can help limit rows before OFFSET is applied. Background Product Hierarchy Path is a field on certain SObjects, which is used to evaluate the applicability of these sObjects on a product, based on its hierarchy path in a bundle. This information is stored on the following SObjects: PromotionItem__c OverrideDefinition__c It is stored in the following fields on both SObjects: ProductHierarchyPath__c - base field containing Product Ids ProductHierarchyGroupKeyPath__c - derived from (1) ProductHierarchyGlobalKeyPath__c - derived from (1) Both derived fields ProductHierarchyGroupKeyPath__c and ProductHierarchyGlobalKeyPath__c can be populated from CMT Admin Console using Upgrade Jobs.', metadata={'title': 'Product Hierarchy Path Validation', 'id': '676318937', 'source': 'https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/display/CMEKB/Product+Hierarchy+Path+Validation'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Script Attachment 250 GitHub Link: Tool Repository Custom Settings Comparator Author: Syed Mehdi Email: smehdi@salesforce.com When to use this tool? The Custom Settings Comparator tool can be used when there is a need to compare Custom Settings between two different organizations. It is particularly useful for replicating customer issues in another org and identifying any differences in settings and their values. Additionally, it can be utilized during sandbox testing, and org migrations or upgrades to ensure consistency and accuracy in Custom Settings across environments. By quickly pinpointing variations, the tool facilitates efficient troubleshooting, replication of issues, and management of org configurations. Tool Description The Custom Settings Comparator is a diagnostic script written in Apex. Its purpose is to serialize and compare the Custom Settings between two Salesforce Orgs. The script provides methods to perform the following operations: Serialize a Custom Setting with default fields from an Org. Serialize a Custom Setting with specific fields from an Org. Compare the Custom Setting fields between two Orgs. The script utilizes an inner class DiagLogger to log diagnostic messages. The log messages are printed as debug logs and follow a specific format with entry types: START , INPUT_PARAMS , RESULT_INFO , RESULT_WARNING , and END . How To Use Serialize the Custom Setting in the first Org : Copy the entire anonymous code to the Apex Execute window within Workbench. Add the following lines to the top of the text area : To serialize a Custom Setting with default fields : java To serialize a Custom Setting with specific fields : java Set the Log Category to Apex Code and Log Level to Debug. Then click on the Execute button. In the Results section, search for Serialized Custom Setting: and copy the string after this. Serialize the Custom Setting in the second Org and compare with the serialized Custom Setting from the first org : Copy the entire anonymous code to the Apex Execute window within Workbench. Add the following lines to the top of the text area : To serialize and compare the Custom Setting with default fields : java To serialize and compare the Custom Setting with specific fields : java Output Result Info logs (Log lines appended by RESULT_INFO| ): S.No. Message Meaning 1. Serialized Custom Setting: <serializedValues> This log line displays the serialized Custom Setting from an org. The <serializedValues> will be replaced with the actual serialized values. 2. Result: <result> This log line displays the result of the comparison between the Custom Settings from Org1 and Org2. The <result> will be replaced with the actual serialized differing values. Result Warning logs (Log lines appended by RESULT_WARNING| ): S.No. Message How to Fix 1. The customSetting input param is blank. Check the input parameter customSetting and ensure it is not blank. 2. <customSetting> is not a valid Custom Setting. Verify the value provided for customSetting and ensure it is a valid Custom Setting. Make sure to append the namespace to the customSetting. 3. Error while fetching the Custom Setting records: <errorMessage> Review the error message to identify the issue with fetching the Custom Setting records. Ensure the specified Custom Setting exists in the org and the correct Custom Setting name is provided. 4. No records found for <customSetting> Verify the value provided for customSetting and ensure it corresponds to an existing Custom Setting. 5. Error deserializing sourceSerializedData. Verify that the serialized string from the first Org is correctly formatted and does not contain any errors. 5. Error deserializing targetSerializedData. Verify that the serialized string from the Second Org is correctly formatted and does not contain any errors. Method Details serializeCustomSetting(String customSettingName) Parameters: customSettingName : The name of the Custom Setting to serialize. Description: Serializes a Custom Setting with the specified customSettingName, including all default fields. Returns: The serialized Custom Setting as a string. serializeCustomSetting(String customSettingName, String fieldNames) Parameters: customSettingName : The name of the Custom Setting to serialize. fieldNames : Comma-separated field names without namespaces. Description: Serializes a Custom Setting with the specified customSettingName and specific fieldNames (comma-separated without namespaces). Returns: The serialized Custom Setting as a string. compareCustomSettings(String customSettingName,String sourceSerializedData, String targetSerializedData) Parameters: customSettingName : The name of the Custom Setting to compare. sourceSerializedData : The serialized Custom Setting from the source org. targetSerializedData : The serialized Custom Setting from the target org. Description: Compares two serialized Custom Settings specified by sourceSerializedData and targetSerializedData for the given customSettingName. Returns: The differences between the two Custom Settings as a JSON string. Logging The script uses the DiagLogger class to log diagnostic messages. The logs follow a specific format and are printed as debug logs. The log entry types include: START : Indicates the start of the diagnostic tool. END : Indicates the end of the diagnostic tool. INPUT_PARAMS : Provides the input parameters used in the tool. RESULT_INFO : Provides informational results. RESULT_WARNING : Provides warning messages. Each log line is prepended with the corresponding entry type and the log message. Note Currently the default fields of only CpqConfigurationSetup__c and GeneralSettings__c Custom Settings are supported. The default fields for the CpqConfigurationSetup__c Custom Setting are - 'Name,SetupValue__c'. The default fields for the GeneralSettings__c Custom Setting are - 'Name,Value__c'. If you want to compare specific fields, then pass the fields in the serializeCustomSetting() method parameter. The fields should be comma separated and without namespace. It is mandatory to append the 'Name' field to the fields string in this case. For example :- java In certain cases where the serialized Custom Setting string is too large, Workbench cannot handle it and will throw an exception - 'Script too large'. Hence it is adviced to use this script mostly to compare the CpqConfigurationSetup__c and GeneralSettings__c Custom Settings with their default fields. If the number of records in the Custom Setting are small, then all the above functionalities can be used.\", metadata={'title': 'Custom Settings Comparator', 'id': '686135204', 'source': 'https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/display/CMEKB/Custom+Settings+Comparator'}),\n",
